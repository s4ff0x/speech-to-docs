## Notion Integration

The app can create a Notion page for each transcription when `NOTION_API_KEY` and `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` are configured. Notion updates run in parallel with Google Docs for speed.

### 1) Create a Notion integration
- Go to Notion Developers → Create a new internal integration.
- Copy the integration secret into `NOTION_API_KEY`.

### 2) Prepare your Notion database
You can use an existing database or create a new one. Share the database with your integration (Share → Invite → select your integration) so it has access.

Required/Supported properties (column names and types):
- Title property (type: Title)
  - Name can be anything. The app auto-detects the Title property.
- Content property (type: Rich text)
  - Recommended names: `content`, `text`, `body`, `description`, or `notes`. The app picks the first matching Rich text property.
- `tags` (type: Multi-select)
  - General tags. The app prioritizes existing options but may add new options here if needed.
  - Property must be named exactly `tags` (case-insensitive). This prevents conflicts with similarly named columns like `project-tags`.
- `category-tags` (type: Multi-select)
  - High-level categories matched conservatively via AI from your transcription.
  - The app will ONLY use options that already exist in this property and will NOT create new options.
  - Create the options you want to be eligible, for example: `dev`, `health`.
- `project-tags` (type: Multi-select)
  - Project-specific tags matched conservatively via AI.
  - The app will ONLY use options that already exist in this property and will NOT create new options.
  - Create the options you want to be eligible, for example: `smart-journal`, `p1v3`, `p1v4`.

Notes:
- `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` may be the raw 32-character ID or the full database URL. The app extracts the ID automatically (hyphens and query params are handled).
- If `category-tags` or `project-tags` properties are missing, they are simply skipped.

### 3) What the app writes to Notion
- Title: generated by AI to summarize the transcription.
- Content: the full transcription text (stored in the first suitable Rich text property).
- `tags`: generated by AI; reuses existing options when possible and may create new options if needed.
- `category-tags`: matched strictly against existing options; never creates new options.
- `project-tags`: matched strictly against existing options; never creates new options.

### 4) Performance
The app performs title generation, `tags`, `category-tags`, and `project-tags` extraction in parallel to reduce latency.
